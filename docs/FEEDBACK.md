- Problem: long-term play should stay hard for looting/exploration, but allow a stable communal base in mid/late game
- Hypothesis: slower zombie repopulation keeps tension in new areas while letting cleared zones stay viable for base building
- Changes:
  - RespawnHours: 72.0 -> 168.0
  - RespawnUnseenHours: 16.0 -> 72.0
  - RespawnMultiplier: 0.10 -> 0.05
- Trial window: next 2-3 sessions
- Result: TBD
- Next step: reassess base safety vs. exploration pressure and adjust respawn or peak pop if needed
